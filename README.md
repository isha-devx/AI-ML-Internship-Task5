# Task 5: Decision Trees & Random Forests

## 🎯 Objective
Implement Decision Trees and Random Forests to classify heart disease patients using medical features.  
Compare performance of a single decision tree with an ensemble method (Random Forest).

## 📊 Dataset
- **Dataset:** Heart Disease (UCI Repository)  
- **File:** `dataset.csv`  
- **Features:** age, sex, chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol, max heart rate, etc.  
- **Target:**  
  - `1` → Heart Disease Present  
  - `0` → No Heart Disease

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Data loading & exploration  
2. Splitting into train & test sets  
3. Training a Decision Tree Classifier  
4. Visualizing the Decision Tree  
5. Training a Random Forest Classifier  
6. Comparing accuracy of both models  
7. Feature importance analysis  
8. Cross-validation for robust evaluation

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Graphviz  

---

## 📈 Results
- **Decision Tree Accuracy:** ~75%  
- **Random Forest Accuracy:** ~85%  
- Random Forest performed better and reduced overfitting  
- Feature importance showed which medical factors are most influential in predicting heart disease
